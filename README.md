# React Game
This game was created for my Capstone Project to complete my course at HyperionDev.

## Game Rules
This game is super easy. You have to align the tetrominos to fill a row. Once a row is filled, it will be cleared and your score will be adjusted. You need to use your arrow keys on your keyboard to move your tetromino left or right, use the 'up' arrow key to rotate your tetromino and the 'down' arrow key to place your tetromino in the row. 

If your tetrominos stack up and reach the top, you lose!

## Clone repository
You can clone the repository to your local drive or you can simply download the code and run _npm install_ to  install the node modules and then select _npm start_ to play the game.
